    A site for obsessively tracking what clothing you wear on a daily
    basis, then telling the world about it.
  </p>
  <p>
    Currently not accepting signups (because that part hasn't been built yet),
    but do contact <a href='https://twitter.com/cackhanded'>@cackhanded</a> if
    you have an interest in tracking the mundane.
  </p>
  <p>
    Try <a href='https://norm.hasworn.com'>norm.hasworn.com</a> for a preview
    of what it would look like if you had tracked what tshirt you wore
    for nearly a decade.
